    <p><a href="https://sewguide.com/fashion-styles/">Fashion and styles</a> has always been one of the the things i love.<br>
       Growing up i'ld take many of my mom's dress that were too tight for her and transform it completely, to a new style of my liking.<br>
       Doing that surprised my mom and most of the time she wouldnt even believe that it was ever one of her dresses.<br>
       All of this coupled with a lot of other things geared my interest
       and fueled my parents support for me towards fashion in the long run.
       Here i am today, a brand owner of a fashion line, can you believe it?!ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
